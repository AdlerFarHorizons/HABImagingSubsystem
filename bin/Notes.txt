PGR Camera Notes

Best resolutions obtained are:
1. highest resolution 1600x 1024 in RAW8 mode (i.e. 8 bits / pixel)
2. 1024 x 768 in RAW16 mode (more colors " 16 bits per pixel)

Mode is set from the following line in CustomImageEx program:
 const PixelFormat k_fmt7PixFmt = PIXEL_FORMAT_RAW16;


Resolution is set from the following lines in the same program:
   fmt7ImageSettings.width = 1024;
    fmt7ImageSettings.height = 768;

FlyCapture2Test does not change anything about the capture except that it has a line to covert the picture before saving it:

       error = rawImage.Convert( PIXEL_FORMAT_RAW16, &convertedImage );

 For some reasons this program appears to save the pictures in B/W after conversion.

More details about pixel formats and other settings are in the FlyCapture2Defs.h header file.
